# Project Log – kiranregmi.com

## Tell me about yourself.
“I’m preparing for a Tier-1 SOC role with hands-on experience in alert triage, log analysis, and identity misuse detection.
I also bring a GRC background, so I’m strong in documentation, escalation clarity, and control validation — which helps me support SOC workflows cleanly.”

## How do you approach investigations?
“I focus on validating alerts, confirming signal quality, correlating events, and documenting findings clearly so escalation is fast and accurate.”

## walm me through a project? (Identity Misuse Detection Lab)
Trigger: What alert or signal started it
Validation: How you confirmed it was real
Investigation: What logs / data you correlated
Outcome: What action or escalation followed

“I treated it like a Tier-1 investigation — validate first, then escalate with evidence.”

## you GRC experience - how does that help in a SOC?
“It helps me document clearly, understand control intent, and escalate with context.
I don’t just say what happened — I explain why it matters.”

## What are you strongest SOC skills?
“Alert triage, log analysis, identity-related investigations, and documentation.
I’m especially comfortable with IAM-related alerts.”

## How do you keep building skills?
“I focus on fundamentals first — Security+, networking, cloud identity — then reinforce them with hands-on labs.”
